⚠️  IMPORTANT: Don't run 'eas build' directly!

Always use one of these commands instead:
  npm run build:ios          # For iOS production builds
  npm run build:android       # For Android production builds  
  npm run eas:build -- [args] # For custom builds

These commands automatically:
  1. Increment the build number
  2. Commit the changes to git
  3. Run the EAS build

If you run 'eas build' directly, the build number won't increment!
